# Xls_converter-OOH_dates_split
My standalone feature for Prism360 that splits sides to month-by-month within given period
For example if the side has period: start: 15.09.2022 - end: 15.11.2022
then after processing xls will have 3 copies of the Side but with split periods: 
15.09.22 - 31.09.22; 
01.10.22 - 31.10.22;
01.11.22 - 15.11.22
